Data scientist with a strong math background and 2+ years of experience in big data, machine learning, and statistics. Passionate about explaining data science to non- business audiences. Programming: Python, R, SQL, CSS, HTML, Shell Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, cartopy, xarray, scipy, nltk, xgboost, hyperopt, matplotlib, seaborn Machine Learning: Decision Trees, SVM, Neural Nets, Regression, Clustering, Boosting, Ensemble Statistical Techniques: Time Series, Probability, Hypothesis Testing, Factor Analysis, ANOVA, PCA : Git, AWS, Spark, Hadoop, Excel, Tableau, MS Office, Command Line, Jupyter Notebook EXPERIENCE Data Scientist Oct 2017 Â Present University of California, Irvine, CA Â ing as a lead developer on NASA sponsored project to analyse climate change in Greenland and Antarctica Â Identified winter-time melt events with around 90% accuracy using Random Forest and GBM algorithms Â Discovered patterns, trends and indicators for global temperature change using Time-Series analysis Â Translated findings to both and non- audiences using Tableau dashboards Â Developed open-source Python package JAWS, which translates data from idiosyncratic ASCII formats into homogenized netCDF format Â Designed unit-testing frame to evaluate accuracy, robustness and fault-tolerance at each stage Â Developed internal infrastructure, data pipelines and queries in SQL using a variety of data files Data Science Associate Instructor Sep 2016 Â Aug 2017 Indiana University, Bloomington, IN Â Assisted students in Python and R with special focus on machine learning models (Ensembling, XGBoost, etc.) Â Delivered a guest lecture on Time Series Analysis and its implementation in R. Â Identified the needs of learners and adapted course content and delivery style to meet their needs Â Telstra Net Challenge: Developed a multi-class classification model to predict the severity of service disruptions on TelstraÂs net. Built the model using Random Forest as well as XGBoost and used the Hyperopt library for tuning the parameters. (Kaggle Rank 55/974) Â Predicting Correct Orientation of a given Picture: Implemented a fully-connected feed-forward net to classify image orientation, with backpropagation algorithm to train the net using gradient descent. Implemented K-Nearest Neighbor. (Neural Net, kNN) Â Predicting Business Success Attributes: Developed a model using Yelp Dataset that helps businesses to identify what factors should they focus to make more profit or help new businesses to identify which location would be ideal for their business to thrive. (Python, Tableau) Â Exploration & Exploitation of DarwinÂs Reading: Discovered correlation between DarwinÂs reading patterns and biographically important events. (RStudio, LDA, PCA, k-means) Â Twitter Dataset Modelling and Analysis: Created MongoDB schemas for representing the twitter data, classified users based on their location and used Google Geocoding API for visualization.
